What the fuck did you just fucking say about the seat of Saint Peter, you little heretic? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in seminary, and I've been involved in numerous secret corruption coverups, and I have over 300 confirmed child molestation convictions. I am trained in apostolic succession and I'm the top theologian in the entire diocese. You are nothing to me but just another schismatic. I will wipe your heresy the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with removing the apocrypha? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting the Virgin Mary (who I do NOT worship) and your lack of confession is being traced right now so you better prepare for the crusade, maggot. The crusade that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your denomination. You're fucking refuted, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can cite the First Council of Nicaea to you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my vulgate. Not only am I extensively trained in abusing altar boys, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Vatican and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable church off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "faith alone" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have paid your fucking indulgences. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit holy water all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking heretical, kiddo. Deus Vult.
